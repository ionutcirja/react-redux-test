# React & Redux test

Simple application to test React and Redux.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ionutcirja/react-redux-test.git
cd react-redux-test
npm i
```

## Startup

In order to run the app in development mode, open a terminal and type (any change into the code will rebuild the code):
```
npm start
```

Now open http://0.0.0.0:8080/ in a browser (preferably Chrome, I didn't test this code in any other browser).

## Tests

To run the tests and check the coverage run
```
npm test
```

To run the tests in watch mode run
```
npm run test:watchAll
```

To run just the tests affected by a modification in a file run
```
npm run test:watch
```
